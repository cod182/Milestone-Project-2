# UX

## User Story

The end user is someone who is looking for a campsite to stay at, near a specific location. The site will be aimed at the anyone looking to travel within the UK. The site will mainly be accessed on mobile/tablet devices due to ease of acces while travelling but will also be disgned for desktop.

The end user will want to be able to find their nearest campsite quickly and get informatino on it. All information will need to be clearly displayed and easy to read. 

## Strategy

### User Needs
- The user needs the site to be accessible mainly on mobile device but equally on tablets and desktops.
- Information must be easy to access, clearly displayed and easy to digest. Font to be used is Roboto and colours will be white and green
- Easily understand how the site works with a simple search bar and easy to find information
- Be able to search for a location and have all campsites in the area displayed
- Be able to click on a campsite to receive more information about the site (Services, location, opening times, website)

### Technical Capabilities



### Business Vision

The business vision is to help people locate an appropriate campsite to book when looking either during or before their travels.


## Scope

- The site will include an about section detailing what the site does and what a user can gain from it.
- It will be easy to enact a search and read the results.


## Structure

- The site will be simply laid out and minimalistic, only covering one page.
- Extra information will be displayed in modals when a user clicks on the relevant link.
- The dynamic will be a map and a search reults section.
- Extra informatino from search results will be displayed in a modal.
- The page will flow as follows: Navigation bar, greeting search input, about section.
- Once a search is run, the greeting seach input will shrink and move higher up the page being replace with a full width map. A search results section will then display below the map and the about section below that.
- The extra information on the search reults will be displayed in a modal when clicked on.
